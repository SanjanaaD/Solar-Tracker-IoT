# Solar-Tracker-IoT
An IoT and ML based dual axis Solar Tracker using an Arduino and Raspberry Pi

## Overview
This project was designed to obtain a solar panel that is able to harvest its maximum possible power for as long as possible thereby improving its efficiency.
With the help of an Arduino, Raspberry Pi and a simple ML algorithm, a solar panel is enabled to track the sun, rotate and position itself accordingly such that no part of the solar array is covered by shade due to any obstructing factors. A smart mechanical system is implemented to adjust the panel to a better angle and position to re-obtain maximum current and voltage therefore producing maximum power output.

## Components Used
1. Photoresistors (LDRs)
2. Servo Motors
3. Arduino Uno
4. Raspberry Pi Zero
5. Solar Panel
6. 12V Battery (Power supply)
